# Tesseract

### Modules required: pygame, math, numpy

#### Visualisation of a 4D cube. Along with its rotations.

## Instructions:

Up and down arrow keys for zooming in and out. Press x, y and z for the respective 3D rotations. Press 1 - 6 (not on the numpad!) for 4D rotations. To see which number causes which rotation, refer to the dictionary located at line 58, or simply do some experimentation. Constants can be changed to observe their effects.
